# # Sampling a latent-trajectory model
#
# In this tutorial we fit a model that combines continuous parameters with a
# large discrete latent variable — a hidden state trajectory — using a `Gibbs`
# sampler that updates the parameters with NUTS and the trajectory with a custom
# latent kernel.
#
# This is the pattern PracticalBayes' [`AbstractLatentKernel`](@ref) interface is
# built for: a block of variables that should not go through HMC (here, a
# discrete infection-state matrix) is updated by a sampler you supply, once per
# Gibbs sweep, while the continuous parameters are differentiated as usual and
# the latent variable is held constant during their gradient steps.
#
# The epidemic model itself — the simulator, the trajectory log-likelihood, and
# the forward-filtering/backward-sampling (iFFBS) kernel — comes from
# [EpidemicTrajectories.jl](https://github.com/EvoArt/EpidemicTrajectories). We
# focus here on wiring it into a PracticalBayes model. The model is a two-state
# susceptible/infected epidemic: each animal is susceptible or infected and moves
# between the two states each day; we observe an imperfect test on some days and
# never see the infection state directly.
#
# We will:
#
# 1. simulate data from known parameters,
# 2. reserve the hidden trajectory as a discrete latent variable,
# 3. write a latent kernel that resamples it,
# 4. compose a `Gibbs` sampler and run it, and
# 5. plot the posterior against the values we simulated from.

# ## Simulate the data

# We simulate ten pens of eight animals over eighty days from known parameters:
# the external and within-pen forces of infection ``\alpha`` and ``\beta``, the
# mean infectious period ``m``, the initial infection frequency ``\nu``, and the
# test sensitivity ``\theta``.

# ## Reserve the hidden trajectory as a discrete latent variable
#
# The hidden state matrix `X` (animals × time) is represented as a matrix-valued
# discrete distribution. PracticalBayes routes a discrete `~` site to the value
# store — a latent block updated by a kernel, held constant during HMC gradients
# — instead of putting it in the parameter vector. Its density is supplied
# through `@addlogprob!` in the model body, so the distribution itself
# contributes nothing.

# [`latent_step`](@ref), returning a `NamedTuple` of new values for its block. It
# reads the current values of the other blocks from `c.values` and, here, calls
# EpidemicTrajectories' `ffbs_sweep!` to resample the whole trajectory.

# parameters. We reparameterise the infectious period as ``m = \tilde m + 1`` so
# the recovery probability stays below one.
